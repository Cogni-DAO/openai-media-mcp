# OpenAI Image Generation MCP Server

Welcome to the OpenAI Image Generation MCP server! üöÄ This project provides an [Model Context Provider (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) Server for OpenAI's DALL-E image generation API. It provides you with:

- ‚úÖ An MCP-compatible server (`mcpServer.js`)
- ‚úÖ JavaScript tools for OpenAI image generation, editing, and variations

Let's set things up!

## üö¶ Getting Started

### ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before starting, please ensure you have:

- [Node.js (v18+ required, v20+ recommended)](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (included with Node)

Warning: if you run with a lower version of Node, `fetch` won't be present. Tools use `fetch` to make HTTP calls. To work around this, you can modify the tools to use `node-fetch` instead. Make sure that `node-fetch` is installed as a dependency and then import it as `fetch` into each tool file.

### üì• Installation & Setup

**1. Install dependencies**

Run from your project's root directory:

```sh
npm install
```

### üîê Set OpenAI API Key

In the `.env` file, you'll need to add your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

You can get your API key from the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

The environment variable is used inside of each tool file to authenticate with OpenAI's API:

```javascript
// environment variables are used inside of each tool file
const token = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
```

## üåê Test the MCP Server with Postman

The MCP Server (`mcpServer.js`) exposes your automated API tools to MCP-compatible clients, such as Claude Desktop or the Postman Desktop Application. We recommend that you test the server with Postman first and then move on to using it with an LLM.

The Postman Desktop Application is the easiest way to run and test MCP servers. Testing the downloaded server first is optional but recommended.

**Step 1**: Download the latest Postman Desktop Application from [https://www.postman.com/downloads/](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

**Step 2**: Read out the documentation article [here](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman-ai-agent-builder/mcp-requests/create/) and see how to create an MCP request inside the Postman app.

**Step 3**: Set the type of the MCP request to `STDIO` and set the command to `node </absolute/path/to/mcpServer.js>`. If you have issues with using only `node` (e.g. an old version is used), supply an absolute path instead to a node version 18+. You can get the full path to node by running:

```sh
which node
```

To check the node version, run:

```sh
node --version
```

To get the absolute path to `mcpServer.js`, run:

```sh
realpath mcpServer.js
```

Use the node command followed by the full path to `mcpServer.js` as the command for your new Postman MCP Request. Then click the **Connect** button. You should see a list of tools that you selected before generating the server. You can test that each tool works here before connecting the MCP server to an LLM.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Connect the MCP Server to Claude

You can connect your MCP server to any MCP client. Here we provide instructions for connecting it to Claude Desktop.

**Step 1**: Note the full path to node and the `mcpServer.js` from the previous step.

**Step 2**. Open Claude Desktop ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Developers** ‚Üí **Edit Config** and add a new MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "<server_name>": {
      "command": "<absolute/path/to/node>",
      "args": ["<absolute/path/to/mcpServer.js>"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop to activate this change. Make sure the new MCP is turned on and has a green circle next to it. If so, you're ready to begin a chat session that can use the tools you've connected.

**Warning**: If you don't supply an absolute path to a `node` version that is v18+, Claude (and other MCP clients) may fall back to another `node` version on the system of a previous version. In this case, the `fetch` API won't be present and tool calls will not work. If that happens, you can a) install a newer version of node and point to it in the command, or b) import `node-fetch` into each tool as `fetch`, making sure to also add the `node-fetch` dependency to your package.json.

### Additional Options

#### üê≥ Docker Deployment (Production)

For production deployments, you can use Docker:

**1. Build Docker image**

```sh
docker build -t <your_server_name> .
```

**2. Claude Desktop Integration**

Add Docker server configuration to Claude Desktop (Settings ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí Edit Config):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "<your_server_name>": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "--env-file=.env", "<your_server_name>"]
    }
  }
}
```

> Add your environment variables (API keys, etc.) inside the `.env` file.

The project comes bundled with the following minimal Docker setup:

```dockerfile
FROM node:22.12-alpine AS builder

WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .

ENTRYPOINT ["node", "mcpServer.js"]
```

#### üåê Server-Sent Events (SSE)

To run the server with Server-Sent Events (SSE) support, use the `--sse` flag:

```sh
node mcpServer.js --sse
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Additional CLI commands

## ‚ûï Available Tools

This MCP server provides the following OpenAI image generation tools:

1. **GenerateImage** - Generate images from text prompts using DALL-E 2 or DALL-E 3
2. **EditImage** - Edit images using DALL-E 2 with text prompts and optional masks
3. **CreateImageVariation** - Create variations of existing images using DALL-E 2

## ‚ûï Adding New Tools

1. Creating new tool files in the `tools/openai-image-generation/` directory
2. Following the existing tool structure and patterns
3. Updating the `tools/paths.js` file to include new tool references
